Step 1
Welcome to the Registration Form project! Start by adding the !DOCTYPE html declaration at the top of the document so the browser knows what type of document it's reading.

Step 2
Below the DOCTYPE, add an html element with a lang attribute set to en, so that you have a place to start putting some code.

Step 3
Next, add opening and closing head and body tags within the html element.

Step 4
Add a title and a meta element to the head. Give your project a title of Registration Form, and give a charset attribute with a value of UTF-8 to your meta element.

Step 5
Nest a self-closing link element within the head element. Give it a rel attribute with value of stylesheet and an href attribute with a value of styles.css.

Step 6
Within the body, provide a heading context for the content, by adding an h1 with the text Registration Form.

Step 7
Below the heading, use the following text within a paragraph element to encourage users to register:
Please fill out this form with the required information

Step 11
As suggested by the title, you are creating a form. So, after the p element, insert a form with an action attribute targeting https://register-demo.freecodecamp.org.

Step 12
The method attribute specifies how to send form-data to the URL specified in the action attribute. The form-data can be sent via a GET request as URL parameters (with method="get") or via a POST request as data in the request body (with method="post").
Set the method attribute to send your form data via a POST request.

Step 13
As the form will have three distinct sections, add three fieldset elements within the form element.

Step 14
The first fieldset will hold name, email, and password fields. Start by adding four label elements to the first fieldset.

Step 15
Add the following text to the label elements:

Enter Your First Name:
Enter Your Last Name:
Enter Your Email:
Create a New Password:

Step 17
Nest an input element within each label. Be sure to add each input after the label text, and include a space after the colon.

Step 18
Following accessibility best practices, link the input elements and the label elements together using the for attribute.
Use first-name, last-name, email, and new-password as values for the respective id attributes.

Step 19
Specifying the type attribute of a form element is important for the browser to know what kind of data it should expect. If 
the type is not specified, the browser will default to text.
Give the first two input elements a type attribute of text, the third a type attribute of email, and the fourth a type 
attribute of password.
The email type only allows emails with a @ and a . in the domain. The password type obscures the input, and warns if the site 
does not use HTTPS.

Step 20
The first input element with a type of submit is automatically set to submit its nearest parent form element.
To handle the form submission, after the last fieldset element add an input element with the type attribute set to submit and 
the value attribute set to Submit.

Step 21
At this point, you should be able to submit the form. However, you might notice not much happens.
To make the form more interactive, add the required attribute to the input elements in the first fieldset.
Now, if you try to submit the form without filling in the required fields, you will see an error message.

Step 22
Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires that the value be a valid email address.
Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of less than 8 characters being submitted.

Step 23
With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that the password must match to be 
considered valid.
Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}
The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. Then, remove the 
minlength attribute, and try it out.

Step 24
Let us go to the next part of the registration form. This section will ask for the type of account the 
user is opening, and will confirm the user has read the terms and conditions.
Start by adding three label elements to the second fieldset.
